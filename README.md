SCIDOG contributes to the rapidly-growing scholarly field of ‘science and religion’ by interlocking the history of theology with the history of knowledge and science. Concretely, the project will investigate how and why professional, academic theologians of Western Christianity – from the Council of Trent to the French Revolution (1545–1789) – included ‘natural knowledge’ produced in the natural sciences and medicine into the academic theological discourse, particularly in scholastic textbooks on dogmatics. Until now, researchers have mostly focused on how theology impacted on the production of scientific knowledge. This project takes the complimentary, opposite view: how did the sciences inform theological thought? The main working hypothesis of the project is that theologians entangled ‘theological knowledge’, e.g. about the ‘Immaculate Conception’ or the ‘Blood of Christ’, with related physiological and natural-philosophical knowledge. 

The project's first objective is to map the premodern roles played by ‘natural knowledge’ within Reformed and Catholic theology, understood as a ‘science’ within the university. Secondly, it will uncover the interplay between different epistemological frameworks (revelation and empiricism), and, thirdly, between different powers in societies (religious and secular institutions). These larger constellations continue to be relevant for scientific, institutional, and societal settings of our own time and yet were shaped during the premodern age, not least through ‘scientific transformations’ taking place within Western societies that were deeply religious, fought confessional wars, and eventually paved the way to secularization and scientism. Abstracting from the case study, the project will broaden and sharpen the historiographical perspective of the field of the history of knowledge by tracing the role of ‘theological knowledge’ for the emergence of the ‘two cultures’ of the humanities and the natural sciences.
