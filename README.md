The early modern period is usually seen as a time of profound changes, including the so-called ‘Scientific Revolution’ and the Protestant Reformation. Historians of science have often linked the two shifts in many different ways, but hitherto have widely neglected the hidden link between dogmatic theology and empirical ‘natural’ knowledge. Dogmatics were pivotal for all Christian confessions in the early modern period and theological university textbooks eagerly and seriously dealt with many topics that seemingly relate to empirical knowledge: Can the bodily resurrection be understood from a physiological point of view? Can the transformation of wine in the blood of Christ be reconciled with natural-philosophical assumptions about the world? SCIDOG presents the first attempt to systematically explore how naturalism informed scholastic and dogmatic theology. Its research agenda will consider theology as a manifestation of ‘scientia’ in the premodern university and therefore include it within the history of science and knowledge.

The project's first objective is to map in which ways ‘natural knowledge’ informed premodern scholastic theology that aimed to give a rational reconstruction of faith. Secondly, it will uncover which effective epistemological frameworks were required and formed by this interplay of empiricism and revelation. Thirdly, it will trace how these epistemological frameworks were embedded within religious and secular institutions of learning that were also driven by political agendas. SCIDOG for the first sheds light on how much of the so-called Scientific Revolution found its way into theology manuals and how this natural knowledge was selected, evaluated, and transformed in the context of dogmatic theology. The project thereby aims to demonstrate the significant role of, as it were, empirico-dogmatic knowledge in premodern Western societies that fundamentally reshaped scientific inquiry, but were also deeply religious – and eventually paved the way to secularization and scientism.
